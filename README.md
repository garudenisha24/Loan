Loan Prediction
Summary

Loan Prediction is a machine-learning project that predicts whether a loan applicant will default (or be approved) using applicant demographic and financial features. The model helps lenders and product teams quickly assess risk, prioritize reviews, and automate decisioning while maintaining explainability and compliance. This repository contains data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and a lightweight inference API for batch and single-record predictions.

Highlights (one-line bullets)

Predicts loan default/approval from applicant features (income, credit history, employment, etc.)

Reproducible pipeline: data → preprocess → features → model → evaluation

Model explainability (SHAP/feature importance) and fairness checks included

Simple Flask/FastAPI inference endpoint and Docker support for deployment

Quick Overview (what’s in this repo)

How it works (short)

Load raw applicant data (income, employment length, credit score, loan amount, purpose, etc.).

Clean and impute missing values; encode categorical variables; scale numeric features.

Train classification model(s) (e.g., XGBoost / RandomForest / Logistic Regression) with cross-validation.

Evaluate with accuracy, AUC-ROC, precision/recall, F1, confusion matrix and calibration plots.

Provide explanation (feature importance, SHAP) and run fairness checks by sensitive groups.

Serve model via API for batch/real-time predictions.
